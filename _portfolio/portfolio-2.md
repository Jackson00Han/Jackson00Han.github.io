Thie project aims to illustrate the multivariate time series forecasting methods. Specifically, we will predict the energy load and price for the next 24 hours in energy market using the following 5 methods. Accurate energy load and price predictions are crucial for optimizing energy resources, reducing operational costs, and maintaining grid stability.
