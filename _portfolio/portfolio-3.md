This project is my final training program for the course 'Introduction to Data Science with Python' offered by Harvard University. It aims to predict the urgency with which a COVID-19 patient will need to be admitted to the hospital from the time of onset of symptoms.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset for this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA). I discovered that the age group '40-50' has the most need for hospital beds, and that fever is the most common symptom among these urgent cases. Using ROC curves for assessment, I constructed and evaluated two models: KNN and Logistic Regression, to predict emergency situations. The debates on model and threshold choices were framed in relation to various real-world situations.
